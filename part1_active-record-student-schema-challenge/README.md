# Active Record Student Schema

##Learning Competencies

* Use Active Record Migrations to create a database
* Use Active Record Queries to query a database
* Infer the behavior and structure of code variables, methods, and objects accessed from test code
* Build test methods with descriptive output and clear indicators of passing tests
* Work with testing libraries like Rspec

##Summary

#### A Note About This Unit

Please be aware that none of the challenges in this unit depend-on or use all of Rails. They *do*, however, use Active Record, which is a part of Rails. If you are familiar with Rails, please don't expect all of the typical Rails `rake` commands to work exactly as they do in Rails. This unit covers just a subset.

#### Overview

You probably remember the [Student Schema](https://github.com/sea-lions-2014/database-drill-student-roster-challenge) challenge from before. In case you don't, let's refresh your memory:

<pre>
+------------+
| students   |
+------------+
| id         |
| first_name |
| last_name  |
| gender     |
| birthday   |
| email      |
| phone      |
+------------+
</pre>

This challenge will get you familiar with the basics of using the Active Record [ORM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) feature that is built-in to Rails, including using [migrations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/v3.2.13/migrations.html) and [validations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/v3.2.13/active_record_validations_callbacks.html).

If you're unfamiliar with the [object-relational mapping (ORM)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectrelational_mapping), or if you've never looked at ActiveRecord before, it's probably worth reading the [Ruby on Rails ActiveRecord Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html).

#### Before You Begin

* Open the `ar-student-schema` directory in the source directory.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using Bundler: `$ bundle`
3. Create your database: `$ rake db:create`  **(This is important!)**


##Releases

###Release 0 : Migrations for Schema Creation

In the `db/migrate/20121011144238_create_students.rb` file, you should use Active Record migrations to implement the `change` method. This will allow us to do all of our database schema modifications completely from within code (rather than using SQLite and SQL Designer).  Use the Railsguides [Migration Overview](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/v3.2.13/migrations.html) to get used to the syntax.

#### Test Your Code

Run your migrations using the following command:

```bash
$ rake db:migrate
```

Before submitting this challenge, you must test your code by using the following command:

```bash
$ rspec spec/migrate_create_table_spec.rb
```

All tests should pass.  If the output of the test is confusing, take a look under the hood.  How does the spec file test for expectations?  This is very similar to ruby, see if you can figure it out.

###Release 1 : Your First Object-Relational Model

Create a class called `Student` (in the `app/models/student.rb` file) that meets the following requirements:

#### User Stories

1. Given a `Student` model object, I should be able to easily retrieve her full name via a `name` method.
2. Given a `Student` model object, I should be able to easily know her age (in years) via an `age` method.

Don't overcomplicate this!  From this user story, we can infer that `student.name` would likely be the syntax to access the `name` method.
What can we infer is needed in the `Student` Class?

#### Test Your Code

Before submitting this challenge, you must test your code by using the following command:

```bash
$ rspec spec/student_spec.rb -e "#name and #age"
```

All tests should pass.

###Release 2 : Validation Magic

Add validations to the `Student` model so that a student cannot be saved unless the following requirements are met:

1. Email addresses must contain at least one `@` character and one `.` character, with at least one character before the `@`, one character between the `@` and first `.`, and at least two characters after the final `.`.
2. Email addresses must be unique across all students.
3. Students must be at least `5` years old.

A great resource for validations is the Railsguides [Validation Overview](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/v3.2.13/active_record_validations_callbacks.html), don't forget to use google too!

#### Test Your Code

Before submitting this challenge, you must test your code by using the following command:

```bash
$ rspec spec/student_spec.rb -e "validations"
```

All tests should pass.


###Release 2 : More Advanced Validations

Add another validation to the `Student` model so that a student cannot be saved unless the following requirement is met:

Phone numbers must contain at least 10 digits, _excluding_ non-numeric characters.

#### Test Your Code

Before submitting this challenge, you must test your code by using the following command:

```bash
$ rspec spec/student_spec.rb -e "advanced validations"
```

All tests should pass.
